## Aim

To predict the test scores of students


## Context

Data set Collected from Kaggle which is uploaded by Mathias Ofosu
* [https://www.kaggle.com/kwadwoofosu/predict-test-scores-of-students]

## Tech stack

## Language - Python

Libraries â€“ pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow

ML Algorithms & techniques - Regression algorithms, Tensorflow Regression, one-hot encoding, Cross Validation, Hyper parameter tuning

## Dataset Exploration

It contains information about a test written by some students. 
It include features such as: 
school, school_location, school_type, teaching_method, number_of_students,	gender,	lunch, pretest,	posttest

## Data Modelling

Dataset is splitted into training and test sets

Training set with 80% of instances and test test with 20% of instances

## Evaluate and Validation

Model validated based on the test scores and mean square error

## Conclusion

From the above comparision of all algorithms with thier acccuracy and mean_absolute_error

LightGBM boosting model performs well with accuracy of 95.04 and mae of 2.48
